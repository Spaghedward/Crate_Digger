# Crate Digger

## Notes/ Workflow/ Done/ Need to Do
### If anything is missing please add it, feel free to add details on your area of the build, so we can use parts of this for the read me file after we are done with the fixes.

### Header/ Nav 
1. Create Logo - Done
2. Create nav bar - Done
3. Style Nav bar - Done
4. Added Favicon to page tab - DONE
5. All links working -DONE

#### Header Nav Bar Issues
1. INDEX PAGE LOGO BUG is fine but upon shrink does not resize
or stay center.  It does not overflow, but on meet the team page
it keeps center and shrinks logo image with resize
2.  MEET TEAM PAGE LOGO BUG - The logo view on full screen/ large screen view seems like it is aligned to the left. 
3.  NAV BAR HOVER - Kim had the nav bar hover working over the words in the nav bar, and for some reason they are not working now.  

#### Page Body
1. Create cards for spotify and ticket master - DONE
2. Style the cards, images, input text describing - DONE
3. Get the cards to layout on the page properly and float with 
resizing the page properly - DONE
4. When you click on Ticketmaster on nav bar, the cursor moves directly into the search box for ticket master. DONE
4. When you click on Spotify on nav bar, the cursor moves directly into the search box for ticket master. DONE

#### Page body issues
1. Box for ticketmaster is up all the time (concerts) which should only appear after a search has been made and should vanish upson refreshing the page, and/ or needs to populate with
new info based on new artist search.
2. Results box STARTED for spotify search, pending finish when output fix is done to limit number of results.
3. Need to change links on team page for nav bar for links for ticketmaster and spotify to move to search box like it does on index page. (I will fix it/ Eric)

#### Spotify API
1. Code page to pull info from spotify - DONE
2. Create javascript page for code - DONE
3. Add code to html page to be able to work with java code - DONE

#### Spotify issues
1. Need to limit how many similar artist show up on page.
2. EXTRA CREDIT (NOT NEEDED UNLESS FINISHED EARLY) Make the artist/ band names clickable so when you click on the name in the list, it will start to play their preview songs in the player below.

#### Ticket Master API
1. Create the code to search for artist/ concerts - DONE
2. Create javascript file for code - DONE

#### Ticket master issues
1. For some reason at all times the window showing random concerts is appearing on the page.  There should not be anything on the page until a search has been performed.
2. Need to see why when a search is done, it is not generating a list on the index page or at least changing the content inside the box.

#### IDEA FOR Ticket and spot
1. After a search has been performed have a reset button appear to click on and clear result maybe???  

#### Page Footer
1. Create a footer and content in the footer with contact info - DONE

#### Page Footer issues
1. Not really needed but maybe if we have time add hover effect to the links on the footer.
2. Delete About US, or change to meet the team.

#### MEET THE TEAM
1. Create a new page with a photo gallery layout - DONE
2. Code the page so it is responsive - DONE
3. Style the cards for each team member - DONE

#### Meet the team issues
1. All photos should already be uploaded, just need to add details per member to finalize the page.
2. Find out if the photo of Adian is really adian that Adam google searched that we used for him.  If not it will be funny if its not really him.

#### Meet the team extra credit (only if we have time)
1. drop a shadow on the cards to create a floating above the background effect.  
2. EXTRA EXTRA CREDIT - It would be funny to have a double photo, meaning one photo there, and when you hover over the photo it changes to another photo. (example - professional photo, but when hover it transitions to a silly photo)

#### READ ME FILE 
1. THIS IS NOT DONE YET, someone needs to get on this while me (Eric) and Gordon are trying to get everything working correctly.  Here is a video that helped me with this page you are reading.

#### If you want to go all out and we have the time to do it crazy professional follow this video (most likely dont have the time to do this way)  If anything do a basic readme similar to this page I made with the notes, and when done watch this next video and change out parts of the page to add even more flavor (which is obviously not really really needed.)
