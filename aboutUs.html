        <p class="text-center"> Sometimes you get tired of listening to the same thing on the radio or maybe
        your playlists are getting old.</p>
        
        <p class="text-center"> Searching for new music can be time consuming so we created Crate Digger.</p>

        <p class="text-center"> Crate Digger is a site made for people looking for new music based off of the artist they already love.</p>

        <p class="text-center"> The music lover can search an artist they already love into the Spotify search box. After hitting submit
        Spotify will find a new random artist based off of the artist you have entered. </p>

        <p class="text-center"> If you like the artist, then Ticket Master will find tour dates to see your new favorite band play.</p>

        <p class="text-center"> Happy listening! </p>
